1. Write a C Program to read a one-dimensional array using runtime initialization, sort the number in ascending order and display sorted numbers.
   Hint.

   1. initialize integer array by getting elements from user
   2. Print original array using loop
   3. Use nested loop to control number of passes
      - first loop counts the number of passes that should be less than size.
      - second loop control number of comparisons per pass.
      - in second loop, compare adjacent elements and swap them if first element is greater than second element.
   4. Output sorted array.

2. Write a program to read a matrix and find the sum of all the digits in its main diagonal.

```
5   6   9
2   5   9
2   3   4

5 + 5 + 4 = 14
```
