## LAB 2 - Group A

1. Write a program to ask user for values, x,y,z (integer), and rotate their values such that x has the value of y, y has the value of z and z has the value of x.

```
Inputs,
Enter X: 5
Enter Y: 6
Enter Z: 8

Output
Your inputs,
X = 5 , Y = 6, Z = 8
After rotation,
X = 6, Y = 8, Z = 5
```

Note: donâ€™t use more than 4 variables.

2. The total distance travelled by a vehicle in t seconds is given by
   > distance = ut + (at2)/2

Where u is the initial velocity, a is the acceleration.
Write a program to evaluate the distance travelled at regular intervals of time, given the values of u and a. The program should provide the flexibility to the user to select his own time intervals and repeat the calculations for different values u and a.

3. Write a program to print the size of various data types in C.
   Hint: use `sizeof()` function.
