## Lab 2 – Group B

1. Ask user for 2 numbers say X and Y. Now swap the number from Y to X and X to Y. You cannot use more than 2 variables.
   Output should look like this:

   ```
   Enter Number X: 5
   Enter Number Y: 6

   Your inputs,
   X = 5, Y = 6
   After swapping,
   X = 6, Y = 5
   ```

2. Given an integer number for 5 digits, write a program that displays the number as follows:

   First Line : all digits
   Second Line : all except first digit
   Third Line : all except first two digit
   …. …….
   Last line : last digit
   For example, the number 12345 will be displayed as

   ```

   12345
   2345
   345
   45
   5

   ```

3. Write a program to print the address of a variable. For this ask user for a floating-point number, store it in a variable. Now you can show the value of the floating-point number and its address. Hint: Use Address Operator `&`

4. An equation of the form

   > ax2 + bx + c = 0

   is known as the quadratic equation. The values of x that satisfy the equation are known as the roots of the equation. A quadratic equation has two roots which are given by the following two formulae.
   ![Quadratic Equation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luzan/C-Classroom-2018/master/Lab/2/B/FV3F5VEIJBPQGGP.LARGE.jpg)

   The program should request the user to input the values of a, b, c and output root1 and root2.
